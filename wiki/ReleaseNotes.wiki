==Release Notes==

*Version 0.4*
 * Issue 23: Double-tapping/clicking does not work
 * Issue 39: Too easy to accidentally click when chording to scroll
 * Issue 43: Hostname:port address still uses default port
 * Issue 28: Pressing the home button doesn't gracefully disconnect from the server
 * Issue 29: Cannot cancel an opening connection
 * Issue 37: Need hysteresis for mouse movement
 * Issue 40: Remote mouse can become stuck down
 * Issue 42: Connecting to server is not modal
 * Issue 45: 16-bit pixel depth uses only 4 bits per component
 * Issue 46: 8-bit pixel depth uses only 2 bits per colour component
 * Issue 48: Connecting to osxvnc server occasionally fails even when CotVNC works

*Version 0.3*
  * If it takes more than a moment to open a connection, an message appears saying "Connecting to server".
  * Connecting is done in the background so the UI isn't frozen.
  * Error messages are much better, describing the actual reason for a connection failure.
  * Shimmer update checking is done in the background, to prevent the UI from becoming locked up if the update server cannot be reached for some reason.
  * Major refactoring of the connection related code.
  * Fixes for issues 1 and 20.

*Version 0.2*
  * Vnsea now has very basic mouse control. Scrolling is now done with two fingers, while a single finger controls the mouse.
  * Support for all encoding formats supported by CotVNC, including JPEG.
  * You can control the desired pixel depth from the server settings to cut down on bandwidth.
  * Better error reporting (i.e. no crash) if a connection cannot be made.
  * Shimmer is included so future updates can be performed automatically.

*Version 0.1*
  * Initial release. Very buggy, and view only.
